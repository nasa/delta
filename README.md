# DELTA

DELTA (Deep Earth Learning, Tools, and Analysis) is a framework for deep learning on satellite imagery.

It is currently under active development.

## Installation

1. Run ./scripts/setup.sh to install DELTA's dependencies in Ubuntu.

Note that DELTA uses python3.

## Running Example Programs

1. Download landsat data to $PROJECT_HOME/data/in/toy_data/
3. python $PROJECT_HOME/bin/chunk_and_tensorflow_test.py --image-path $PROJECT_HOME/data/in/toy_data/landsat/<image.tiff> --output-folder $PROJECT_HOME/data/out/test

And the program should execute.  After execution to see the results using MLFlow:

1. cd $PROJECT_HOME/data/out/
2. mlflow ui
3. Open a web browser to http://localhost:5000

## Running sc_process_test_tfrecord.py

This is the main tool for testing networks. It requires a config file as an argument, see
sample_config.txt in this folder.  The input files need to be in .tfrecord format, which
can be generated by running the bin/convert_input_image_folder.py tool on a folder of
input images or labels to generate the equivalent folder containing .tfrecord files.  The
type of image needs to be specified when running the conversion tool, but it does not
need to be specified again when running on the converted images.

The older tool sc_process_test.py is deprecated.
